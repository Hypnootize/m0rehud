//---------------------------
// Basefile Logging Setup
//---------------------------
MOVE ALL CUSTOMIZATIONS TO A SEPARATE FOLDER!!!!!!!!!!

Build the customization menu, redesign once the base is there, possibly split in different files (or at least the crosshairs)

- hp warning option

//---------------------------
// General Stuff
//---------------------------
- switch mod_textures to #base
- Redo Disguise and Taunt Menus, they still overlap with minmode in this version
- Possibly add color aliases for most colors
- Clean up other menus like I did for backpack
