// Basefile Logging Setup
//---------------------------
- Redo resolutions overrides for the scoreboard so they actually make fucking sense
- Fine tune fonts for each res
- Test killstreaks, heads counter and add Escape Plan overrides, whenever my internet comes back

Find a way to make the remaining customizations work as well as the crosshairs damage flash

MOVE ALL CUSTOMIZATIONS TO A SEPARATE FOLDER!!!!!!!!!!

Build the customization menu, using the workshop menu probably.
