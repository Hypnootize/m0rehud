Find a way to make the remaining customizations work as well as the crosshairs damage flash

MOVE ALL CUSTOMIZATIONS TO A SEPARATE FOLDER!!!!!!!!!!

Build the customization menu, using the workshop menu probably.

// General Stuff
//---------------------------
- Tournament Readyup and Spectator borders more inline with the rest of the HUD
- Add Round Counter Option
- switch mod_textures to #base
- Redo Disguise and Taunt Menus, they still overlap with minmode in this version
- Possibly add color aliases for transparent black and most colors
- Clean up other menus like I did for backpack
