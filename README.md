[Changelogs](https://github.com/Hypnootize/m0rehud/commits/master)


<a>INSTALLATION</a>
====

**1)** Extract/Unzip the hud

**2)** Copy the m0rehud folder (**NOT** m0rehud-Master, the one inside it!)

**3)** Paste The folder to your custom tf folder (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom\m0rehud)

**4)** Go to Resource/Fonts select all the font and install them (rightclick while selected and install)

**NOTES:**

In case you are using a **4:3, 5:4 or 16:10** aspect ration be sure to use the right patches in order to make the hud compatible with these resolutions. 

You can find the patches inside the customization folder, open the folder that matches your aspect ration and take the "resource" folder in it, last replace it over the normal m0rehud files!

I suggest using **"tf_hud_target_id_disable_floating_health" "1"** since the floating version is not as consistan and can have problems.


<a>CUSTOMIZATION</a>
====

m0rehud supports different customizations!

All the customizations can be found inside the Customization folder and from there all you need to do is:

**1)** Choose which customization you want to apply and open the dedicated folder (each folder has a screen of the customization as well)

**2)** Copy all the folders found inside

**3)** Paste and replace them over the normal m0rehud files!

**Other than that is also possible to easily change the colors by editing the m0recolors file**

Inside that file is possible to change all the colors used for the health/ammo/buff/hurt/uber and many more!


<a>CROSSHAIRS</a>
====
All the hud crosshairs can be found inside the scripts/crosshairs folder!

It is possible to enable them from the crosshairs.res file by setting **"visible" "1"** for the wanted crosshair.

It is also possible to easily animate them so the crosshair turns red on damage by editing the HudAnimations_Crosshairs file, you can find all the instructions inside the file!
