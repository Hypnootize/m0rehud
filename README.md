## F.A.Q.

### 1) Why are my Fonts look weird/different from the screenshots?

This happens if you haven't installed the custom fonts on your system.
You can fix this by going to the resource/fonts folder and installing the fonts on your system. (usually double-click or right-click)


### 2) How can I customize the HUD myself?

It's really easy. If you've installed the HUD correctly, select what customization you want to apply and copy the resource folder to your 'tf2/custom' folder.
For example if you want to apply the "Timer With Background" customization, open the "Timer With Background" folder and copy the resource folder to your 'tf2/custom' folder. Make sure to replace the customization files over your old hud files.


### 3) Where I can find and enable the hud crosshairs?

Open Crosshairs.res file in the scripts folder. You can edit this file and set the visible value of the crosshair you want to 1.


### 4) How can I get bigger damage numbers?

Open Resource > HudDamageAccount.res . You need to change both "delta_item_font" and "delta_item_font_big" (default font is M0refont18Outline) to one of these alternatives:

M0refont20Outline - M0refont21Outline - M0refont22Outline - M0refont23Outline - M0refont24Outline - M0refont30Outline
